2. Open databases/db_site.sql to change the database name, table if needed, and the user name. If you already have a db for the website, use it
3. If needed, edit databases/tb_user.sql and databases/datas_users.sql to change the structure of users's table and its 4 datas exemple.3. run these 3 files in terminal to insert them into mySQL
